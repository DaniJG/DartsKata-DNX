# DartsKata-DNX
Built with DNX beta7, supporting both full .net and core frameworks.
Unit tests written with the xunit framework and the preview xunit.runner.dnx.

For running tests:

- In the command line, switch to the test project `cd .\test\DartsKata.Test` and then run the tests with the command `dnx test`

- In Visual Studio, build the whole solution and either run tests from Test Explorer or using a shortcut like `Ctrl + R, A`
